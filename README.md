# Monte Carlo Cpp

the Monte Carlo technique holds a significant place in the history of computer science, originating from the early days of computational methods. Many of the initial Monte Carlo codes were written in Fortran, a language that has stood the test of time and remains relevant today. It is fascinating to observe that even in the present day, numerous researchers and professionals continue to rely on these legacy Fortran codes for their Monte Carlo simulations.

That being said, it is essential to acknowledge the emergence of modern programming languages like C++, which offer a plethora of benefits over older languages. Although C++ may not be as commonly associated with Monte Carlo simulations, it is gaining traction in this field. The advantages of C++ include enhanced performance, greater flexibility, and a more extensive library ecosystem, making it an attractive option for those looking to implement Monte Carlo methods.


As the field of computer science evolves and the need for more efficient and powerful simulations grows, it is likely that the usage of modern languages like C++ for Monte Carlo simulations will increase. 

Here, as a small attempt, I tried to convert a classical MC code in physics from Fortran to Cpp.
